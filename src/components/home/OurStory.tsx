                  Our journey started with Eric Markovcy, whose son Ryan was born as a micro-preemie at just 1.3 pounds. Despite quality therapy, Ryan's feeding challenges were only resolved when a therapist was consistently present in the home.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
                  That transformation inspired Eric to team up with Canaan Kimballâ€”a student-athlete at Lehigh University with a background in engineering and entrepreneurship. Together, they built Screenwise Eating: a scalable platform that supports therapists in delivering better care outside the clinic.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
                  Today, we're a growing team of engineers, clinicians, and researchers driven by one goal: to make feeding therapy more effective, accessible, and data-informed.
