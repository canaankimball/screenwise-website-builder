                    These Terms, and all matters relating to the Services, and any disputes and claims arising therefrom or related thereto between you and YumEats (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by Pennsylvania law, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law that might require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. You and YumEats agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Pennsylvania, and you and YumEats agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable Dispute.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    "Disputes" are any disputes, claims, actions, and other controversies between you and YumEats or between you and the affiliates or agents of YumEats that, in either case, arise out of or relate to these Terms, the Services, or any other products or services related thereto, whether based in contract, tort, warranty, fraud, misrepresentation, statute, regulation, or another legal or equitable basis.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    If you have a Dispute with YumEats or if YumEats has a Dispute with you, you or YumEats must first attempt to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiation for a period of sixty (60) days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties ("Informal Resolution Period") from the day either party receives a written notice of a Dispute from the other party (a "Claimant Notice") in accordance with these Terms. The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines for a Dispute will be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that Dispute so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    A valid Claimant Notice must be in writing and include all of the following: (i) the name, address and email address of the party giving notice, (ii) a description of the nature and facts of the Dispute, (iii) the relief requested, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation of them, (iv) an acknowledgement that the Dispute is subject to these Terms, and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the notice. A Claimant Notice must be individualized, meaning it can only concern yours or YumEats' Dispute and no other person's or entity's Dispute.

                    If a party receives a Claimant Notice, the receiving party will acknowledge receipt of the Claimant Notice and make a good faith effort during the Informal Resolution Period to either resolve the Dispute or explain why the claimant is not entitled to relief. Neither you nor YumEats may commence any court action or other legal proceeding regarding a Dispute before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or YumEats file a court action or other legal proceeding regarding a Dispute without complying with the requirements in Section 1, including waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party may (i) seek relief from a court to enjoin the filing until the requirements in this Section are fully met and (ii) seek damages from the party that has not followed the requirements in this Section to reimburse it for any costs incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The recipient of a Claimant Notice may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference, and both parties shall personally attend (with counsel, if represented) any conference that is held. You and YumEats agree to work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time (with the Informal Resolution Period being extended as needed until that time) and to seek to reach a resolution during any such conference.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This Section 1(e) will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. NO DISPUTE SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER DISPUTE, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES. NO CLASS ACTION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH EITHER YOU OR YUMEATS ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY SHALL BE PERMITTED, AND NEITHER YOU NOR YUMEATS WILL PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES RELATED THERETO. ANY RELIEF MAY BE AWARDED ONLY INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REDRESS YOUR OR YUMEATS'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S); RELIEF MAY NOT BE AWARDED ON BEHALF OF OTHERS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">One Year to Assert Claims</h4>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    In no event shall you or YumEats send a Claimant Notice or commence litigation over any Dispute more than one (1) year after the Dispute first arose. After such time, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you or YumEats will no longer have the right to assert that Dispute.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Severability</h4>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    If any part of this Section 1 is found to be unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms and (ii) the remainder of these Terms will remain in effect. If the class action waiver in Section 1(e) is found to be unlawful or unenforceable in a state for any reason, to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, claimants may seek certification only of a class composed of residents of that state. Further, if any part of this Section 1 is found to unlawfully prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought, and the remainder of this Section 1 will be enforceable.

                  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Third-Party Beneficiaries</h4>

                    You must resolve Disputes with our past, present, and future affiliates and agents as though they were or are YumEats. Such affiliates and agents are third-party beneficiaries of this Section 1 and can enforce this Section 1 as though they were or are YumEats in the event they become involved in a Dispute with you. Otherwise, these Terms are only for the benefit of, and will only be enforceable by, you and YumEats only and do not give rights to any third parties.
