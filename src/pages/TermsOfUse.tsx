Terms of Use

Last Updated: 5/25/2025

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE, USE THE SITE, OR INDICATE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.

These Terms of Use (“Terms” or “Terms of Use”) constitute an agreement between you (“you” or the “user”) and Screenwise Eating, LLC and its affiliates, subsidiaries or assigns (collectively, “YumEats,” “we,” “us” or “our”).  This website (the “Site”) is owned and operated by YumEats.  Access and use of this Site and our services provided through the Site, application, and offline (together, the “Services”) are provided by YumEats to you on condition that you accept these Terms of Use.  By accessing or using the Services, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to accept these Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Services.

We reserve the right at any time to change: (i) the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use; (ii) the Services, including terminating, eliminating, supplementing, modifying, adding or discontinuing any content or feature or data or service on or available through the Services or the hours that they are available; (iii) any fees or charges, if any, related to the use of the Services; and (iv) the equipment, hardware or software required to use and access the Services.

Any changes we make to these Terms of Use will be effective immediately upon posting on this Site.  Please return to this Site periodically to ensure you are familiar with the most current version of these Terms of Use.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND YUMEATS CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER AND REQUIRES ALL DISPUTES TO BE BROUGHT SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Governing Law and Venue.  These Terms, and all matters relating to the Services, and any disputes and claims arising therefrom or related thereto between you and YumEats (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by Pennsylvania law, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law that might require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.  You and YumEats agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Pennsylvania, and you and YumEats agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable Dispute.  
“Disputes” are any disputes, claims, actions, and other controversies between you and YumEats or between you and the affiliates or agents of YumEats that, in either case, arise out of or relate to these Terms, the Services, or any other products or services related thereto, whether based in contract, tort, warranty, fraud, misrepresentation, statute, regulation, or another legal or equitable basis.
Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Litigation. If you have a Dispute with YumEats or if YumEats has a Dispute with you, you or YumEats must first attempt to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiation for a period of sixty (60) days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties (“Informal Resolution Period”) from the day either party receives a written notice of a Dispute from the other party (a “Claimant Notice”) in accordance with these Terms.  The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines for a Dispute will be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that Dispute so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.

A valid Claimant Notice must be in writing and include all of the following: (i) the name, address and email address of the party giving notice, (ii) a description of the nature and facts of the Dispute, (iii) the relief requested, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation of them, (iv) an acknowledgement that the Dispute is subject to these Terms, and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the notice.  A Claimant Notice must be individualized, meaning it can only concern yours or YumEats’ Dispute and no other person’s or entity’s Dispute.

You will send any Claimant Notice to YumEats at the following address:

            YumEats 

Re: Notice of Dispute

4432 Vera Cruz Road
Center Valley, Pennsylvania 18034

with a copy by email to screenwiseeating@gmail.com with the subject heading: “Notice of Dispute.”

We will send any Claimant Notice to you at the contact information we have for you.

If a party receives a Claimant Notice, the receiving party will acknowledge receipt of the Claimant Notice and make a good faith effort during the Informal Resolution Period to either resolve the Dispute or explain why the claimant is not entitled to relief. Neither you nor YumEats may commence any court action or other legal proceeding regarding a Dispute before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or YumEats file a court action or other legal proceeding regarding a Dispute without complying with the requirements in Section 1, including waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party may (i) seek relief from a court to enjoin the filing until the requirements in this Section are fully met and (ii) seek damages from the party that has not followed the requirements in this Section to reimburse it for any costs incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.
Meet and Confer.  The recipient of a Claimant Notice may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference, and both parties shall personally attend (with counsel, if represented) any conference that is held.  You and YumEats agree to work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time (with the Informal Resolution Period being extended as needed until that time) and to seek to reach a resolution during any such conference.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  This Section 1(e) will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. NO DISPUTE SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER DISPUTE, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES.  NO CLASS ACTION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH EITHER YOU OR YUMEATS ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY SHALL BE PERMITTED, AND NEITHER YOU NOR YUMEATS WILL PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES RELATED THERETO. ANY RELIEF MAY BE AWARDED ONLY INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REDRESS YOUR OR YUMEATS’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S); RELIEF MAY NOT BE AWARDED ON BEHALF OF OTHERS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
One Year to Assert Claims. In no event shall you or YumEats send a Claimant Notice or commence litigation over any Dispute more than one (1) year after the Dispute first arose.  After such time, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you or YumEats will no longer have the right to assert that Dispute.
Severability. If any part of this Section 1 is found to be unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms and (ii) the remainder of these Terms will remain in effect.  If the class action waiver in Section 1(e) is found to be unlawful or unenforceable in a state for any reason, to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, claimants may seek certification only of a class composed of residents of that state.  Further, if any part of this Section 1 is found to unlawfully prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought, and the remainder of this Section 1 will be enforceable.
Third-Party Beneficiaries.  You must resolve Disputes with our past, present, and future affiliates and agents as though they were or are YumEats.  Such affiliates and agents are third-party beneficiaries of this Section 1 and can enforce this Section 1 as though they were or are YumEats in the event they become involved in a Dispute with you. Otherwise, these Terms are only for the benefit of, and will only be enforceable by, you and YumEats only and do not give rights to any third parties.
